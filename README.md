# Youter project
This is my personal after work project where I am experimenting with technologies/frameworks that I'm interested in. 
Currently I'm aiming integration testing with Arquillian. I need to validate if it is possible to develop rich client 
application written in EcmaScript with tons of transpilations and so on and use Java for integration and e2e testing. 







## Objectives
-  [ ] Run the app using spring boot 
-  [ ] Add Arquillian and bootstrap e2e testing
-  [ ] Add some frontend in javascript needed to test use case of local continuous integration and redeployment
